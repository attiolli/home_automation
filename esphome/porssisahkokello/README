Esphome based led controller to control a 60 led ring to show electricity spot prices per hour.

The code is using this API endpoint to retrieve price data: https://elspotcontrol.netlify.app/spotprices-v01-FI.json

Instructions:
  - Hook up you esp32 board with led ring pins for GND, VCC and GPIO for addressable led data
  - Check the light component GPIO pin (GPIO27 as default for data on the code) to match your setup.
  - Check esp32 board type to match your environment
  - Check wifi (and ap under that) component config to match your environment
  - Load the code to the esp32 board
  - Connect to the device IP or mDNS name and set the following parameters as you wish:
    - LED Brightness (between 0.0 - 1.0 as %, value 0.22 seems fairly good)   
    - Set high price threshold (Price in Eur - If hour price is above this, leds are turned red to indicate expensive hours)
    - Set low price threshold (Price in Eur - If hour price is below this, leds are turned green to indicate cheap hours)
    - (Hours that are between cheap and expensive are colored as yellow(ish) )

Optionally:
  - Enable API on the code to set HomeAssistant connectivity


Essential parts used:
  - ESP32 dev board (I use ezsbc ESP32 Breakout and Development Board which was laying around)
  - DC5V WS2812B LED Ring 5050 RGB Individually Addressable 60 93 Pixels 
    Round Modules 3Pin Smart BuiIt-in IC Black White PCB Circle (Aliexpress)
